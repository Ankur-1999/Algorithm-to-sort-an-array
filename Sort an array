# Psudo code 
# List of integers
#  take a variable to check the length of array
# create a new  blank list to hold the sorted value
#intilaize i= 0 for index
# use a while loop to check the ever integers in the list
#using min we would retreive the minimum value from the list (a)
#You store this  suceeding minimum number in your new list (new_a) 
# Now you have to delete that minimum number from the list a
# Take i += 1 This starts the whole process again.
# then print the new list
